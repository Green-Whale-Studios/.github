### Members
* @SuitablyMysterious - Founder
* @JigglyJeff - Founder
* @HippoProgrammer - The random guy who occasionally helps and will probably have his repo editing rights revoked soon. He does most of the good coding and none of the good ideas
### Projects
### In active development
* No projects are currently in active development

### Development has paused
* The Vega Initiative - a 2D citybuilder built in Pygame-ce and compiled for web using pygbag (in pygame, so it crashes about as often as you'd expect)
  * The Vega Initiative DEV - a devbuild - a 2D citybuilder built in Pygame-ce and compiled for web using pygbag

### Development has concluded
* Trapped On The Moon - a Makecode Arcade game - collect resources from the Moon to buy your freedom!
  * Trapped On The Moon GODOT - a Godot 4 game - collect resources from the Moon to buy your freedom! (but in Godot, so it crashes marginally less often)
